      <h2>Math Tutor</h2>
      <p>
        I have tutored many students in math with various skill levels, helping them grasp complex concepts and build confidence in their abilities. Many students initially struggled however, helping them through problems allowed them to develop a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts.
        <br><br>I learned how to tailor my explanations to different types of learning styles. For example, some students are visual learners, while others need a more logical step-by-step breakdown. Staying patient and adapting helps ensure students feel supported rather than overwhelmed. Throughout my experience tutoring, I have strenghtened my ability to break down complex ideas.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Skills Gained: </strong>  Communication, problem-solving, adaptability, mentoring.</p>

      <h2>iGEM</h2>
      <p>This year, I joined The University of Guelph iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machine) team as a Modelling & Software Engineering Member and Web Design member. My passion for science as well as software development led me to apply for iGEM.</p>
      <!-- role 1 -->
      <h3>Web Design Member</h3>
      <p>I am currently taking a web design course in which I have gained many skills that will help me when contributing to the iGEM website for our 2025 project. As a member of the University of Guelph's iGEM team, I will be contributing to designing and developing a website that effectively presents our synthetic biology project. The goal is to create a user-friendly interface that showcases research findings, team contributions, and technical documentation.
      <br><br>
      I am working closely with other team members to create the website. Our goal is to ensure that complex biological concepts are presented clearly to a broad audience, including judges, researchers, and the general public. I am excited for this experience as it allows me to refine my front-end development skills and improve user experience. Through this project, I hope to deepen my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and create an accessible, user-friendly website.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> JavaScript, HTML, CSS</p>
      <p><strong>Skills:</strong> Web design, teamwork, problem-solving</p>
      <!-- role 2 -->
      <h3>Modelling & Software Engineering</h3>
      <p>As part of the Software and Modeling team, I will be contributing to computational models that simulated biological processes related to our research. I am excited to continue working on this project and bridge the gap between software engineering and biology. Writing efficient code for simulations will require careful consideration of real-world biological constraints. I am also excited to work closely with wet lab researchers to learn more about the scientific side of the project and ensure that our models reflect actual experimental data.</p>
      <p><strong>Skills:</strong> Software development, mathematical modeling, interdisciplinary collaboration, problem-solving</p>

      <h2>GWICS</h2>
      <p>GWICS (Guelph Women in Computer Science) hosted an event called GoCodeGirl which was a coding workshop aimed at introducing young girls to programming and computer science. There were different stations that each group would visit to try a new challenge. As a group leader, I led my group to each of the stations and helped them complete the given challenge and understand the logic behind the programming. I enjoyed this event as it provided an opportunity to mentor and support girls who were curious about technology but didnâ€™t necessarily have prior experience.</p>
      <p><strong>Skills:</strong> Mentoring, collaboration, Leadership, problem-solving</p>
